## Prerequisites

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Instead of manually downloading dependencies, you can run the `download_dependencies.bat` file to automatically download and extract `wget`, `yt-dlp`, and `FFmpeg`.
   - Alternatively, manually download and install the following tools:
     - [wget](https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/) - Command-line file downloader.
     - [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases) - Advanced YouTube downloader.
     - [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) - Required for merging video and audio streams.  
       - Ensure `ffmpeg.exe` is available in your system's PATH or placed in the same directory as the script.

2. **Ensure the following files are in the same folder:**
   - `download_to_folder.bat`
   - `context_menu_add.reg` (for adding the context menu entry).
   - `context_menu_remove.reg` (for removing the context menu entry).
   - `add_shift_context_menu.bat` (for adding the "Download Here" option with Shift).
   - `remove_shift_context_menu.bat` (for removing the "Download Here" option with Shift).
   - `video.txt` (to define sites handled by `yt-dlp`).
   - `download.ico` (icon used for the context menu option).

## Notes

- **Supported Video Formats:**
  - Videos are downloaded in the best available quality and merged into MP4 format whenever possible.

  - Keep `yt-dlp` up-to-date by running the `update_yt-dlp.bat` file to automatically update `yt-dlp`.

- **Troubleshooting:**
  - If downloads fail, check for available formats with:
    ```cmd
    yt-dlp.exe --list-formats <URL>
    ```

- **FFmpeg Path:**
  - Ensure `ffmpeg.exe` is correctly installed or included in the same directory as the script for merging video and audio.

- **Context Menu Icon:**
  - The context menu option is accompanied by a custom icon, `download.ico`, which will be shown next to the "Download Here" entry.
