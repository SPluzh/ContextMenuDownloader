# Context Menu Downloader

This project adds a **"Download Here"** option to the Windows Explorer context menu. It enables users to download files from URLs stored in the clipboard using `wget` or `yt-dlp`, depending on the type of link.  
It also supports saving **images directly from the clipboard** as PNG files.

## Prerequisites

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Run `download_dependencies.bat` to automatically download and extract `wget`, `yt-dlp`, and `FFmpeg`.
   - Alternatively, manually download and install the following tools:
     - [wget](https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/) - Command-line file downloader.
     - [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases) - Advanced YouTube downloader.
     - [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) - Required for merging video and audio streams.  
       - Ensure `ffmpeg.exe` is available in your system's PATH or placed in the same directory as the script.

2. **Ensure the following files are in the same folder:**
   - `download_to_folder.bat`
   - `add_context_menu.bat` (for adding the context menu entry).
   - `add_shift_context_menu.bat` (for adding the "Download Here" option with Shift).
   - `remove_context_menu.bat` (for removing the context menu entry).
   - `video.txt` (to define sites handled by `yt-dlp`).
   - `download.ico` (icon used for the context menu option).
   - `update_yt-dlp.bat` (for updating `yt-dlp`).

## Installation

1. **Clone or Download This Repository:**
   - Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/SPluzh/ContextMenuDownloader.git
     ```
   - Or download the ZIP file and extract it.

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Run `download_dependencies.bat` to download and set up `wget`, `yt-dlp`, and `FFmpeg`.

3. **Add to the Context Menu:**
   - Run `add_context_menu.bat` to add the **"Download Here"** option.  
     **Note:** These actions may require administrator privileges.  
     - **Recommendation for Windows 11:** Using the Shift+Right-Click option (`add_shift_context_menu.bat`) is recommended, as the standard context menu in Windows 11 is simplified and may hide additional entries.

4. **Edit `video.txt`:**
   - Open `video.txt` with a text editor.
   - Add domains (one per line) for sites to be handled by `yt-dlp` (e.g., `youtube.com`, `vimeo.com`).

## Usage

1. **Copy a URL or Image to the Clipboard:**
   - You can copy any file URL (e.g., a direct download link or video URL).
   - You can also copy an image (e.g., from a browser, screenshot tool, or image viewer).

2. **Right-Click in the Desired Folder:**
   - If you installed the context menu using `add_context_menu.bat`, simply right-click in the folder where you want to save the file or image.  
   - If you used `add_shift_context_menu.bat`, hold the `Shift` key, then right-click in the folder where you want to save the file or image.

3. **Select "Download Here":**
   - If an image is detected in the clipboard, it will be saved as a `.png` file with a timestamped filename.
   - If a URL is detected:
     - `wget` is used for regular file downloads.
     - `yt-dlp` is used for video links matching entries in `video.txt`.

## Notes

- **Supported Video Formats:**
  - Videos are downloaded in the best available quality and merged into MP4 format whenever possible.

- **Updating Tools:**
  - If downloading videos stops working, update `yt-dlp` by running the `update_yt-dlp.bat` file.

- **Troubleshooting:**
  - If downloads fail, check for available formats with:
    ```cmd
    yt-dlp.exe --list-formats <URL>
    ```

- **FFmpeg Path:**
  - Ensure `ffmpeg.exe` is correctly installed or included in the same directory as the script for merging video and audio.

- **Context Menu Icon:**
  - The context menu option is accompanied by a custom icon, `download.ico`, which will be shown next to the "Download Here" entry.
